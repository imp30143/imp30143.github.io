	<p> Crazy Ex-Girlfriend (<a href="http://www.cwtv.com/">The CW</a>), Alone Together (<a href="https://freeform.go.com/">Freeform</a>), 
	The Office, and Parks and Recreation (both from <a href="https://www.nbc.com/video">NBC</a>),  are examples of iconic sit-coms. 
	Each show stands out in it's own way, yet they all have one thing in common. The style of comedy these shows have in common is 
	cringe comedy. Cringe comedy is a style of jokes which are often centered around a likable, but overall awkward characters. 
	Many times, their flaws are exploited for the entertainment of the audience.</p>

	<p>In CXG, for example,	the protagonist, Rebbecca Bunch, makes insane choices, such as moving across the country to be nearer 
	to her high school summer camp boyfriend, Josh Chan. Over the course of four seasons, we watch Rebbecca repeatedly get herself 
	in and out of trouble. The show is funny, because many of the uncomfortable facts of life, such as falling in love with someone 
	you shouldn't, are approached without the finesse you might see in a romance. Most of the time, the characters and events are 
	placed in familiar, if not over-done, scenes. Most of the action in CXG takes place in a Boba shop or a Donut shop. Although 
	the sets are dramatic, the audience can feel familiar with the setting, rather than the extravagance of cinema.</p>
